A program I made during the COVID-19 pandemic to help me with my classes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic I was a fully virtual student during the school year 2020-2021.

Throughout this school year I had different classes every single day, and decided to make a program to help me know which classes I have for that respective day.

This program signs into my power school, takes a screenshot of my classes, puts it into an email, and then emails it to me if it is a certain time.
